# Scripts and configuration for provisioning

"Provisioning" is a jargon term loosely taken to mean the configuration of
machines. This directory contains scripts and configuration files required to
get the software in this repo up and runnning on different machines and/or
operating systems.

Only venture in here if you self-identify with the term "DevOp".
